# hello-world
This repository is the start of my life reboot into coding!

So, I went to school to be a musician. I graudated from college and started rockin' shows around New England. Then I met Jenny. Things moved fast - we moved in together and had our first kid on our second anniversary. Holy cow. Now I'm working a sorta bum job and really want to get into Full-Stack Web development. So... here we go.
